    "about": "Mechatronics engineering is the design of computer-controlled electromechanical systems. It can be viewed as 'modern mechanical engineering design' in the sense that the design of the mechanical system must be performed together with that of the electrical/electronic and computer control aspects that will comprise the complete system.",

In addition to the courses listed, a student is required to select technical elective and complementary studies courses as described below. All students in the Faculty of Engineering are permitted to take an option (as described in Options, Specializations and Electives for Engineering Students of this section of the calendar). Mechatronics Engineering students are not permitted to take the Mechatronics Option. In many cases earning an option will require a number of courses in addition to the core and elective structure given below. The first students were admitted to the Mechatronics Engineering Program in the fall of 2003. The courses listed as MTE courses, although listed in this calendar, will not be offered until the first students enrolled in the Mechatronics Engineering Program reach the level requiring these courses.",
