    "about": "Biomedical engineering lies at the interface of engineering and life sciences. Using engineering and design principles, a biomedical engineer works towards the advancement of biology and medicine, developing innovative technologies and solutions to health-related problems, such as new tools and models to diagnose, monitor, treat and prevent disease.\nThe undergraduate program in Biomedical Engineering, housed in the department of Systems Design Engineering at Waterloo, is a stand-alone engineering program. The program provides an integrated systems approach to the study of biomedical engineering, where basic knowledge and skills such as biology, mechanics, physics, chemistry, system analysis and design are taught in the context of biomedical related applications while taking into consideration the complexity of biomedical systems.",

        "about": "The Biomedical Engineering curriculum is specifically designed to provide students with a clear understanding of human physiological systems and systems analysis and theory, combined with a thorough knowledge of engineering and design principles. Life sciences and biomedical engineering design are taught right from the start of first year. The first three years of the program are intended to provide each student with a solid engineering background in areas relevant to biomedical issues.\nThroughout these three years the student's ability to grasp real engineering problems is enhanced by courses in systems design methodology followed by a series of challenging problem-solving experiences in the Biomedical Design Workshops. A focus is then given to the whole curriculum and the student learns to apply the lecture material, to develop skills in solving biomedical problems while developing design and project management abilities.\nThe final year of the program is comprised mostly of TEive courses, allowing the student to focus on one or more areas of study. This provides the required background for a future year of advanced study to the MASc degree, or for a rewarding career in industry or government with a Bachelor's degree (BASc).",
