    "about": "The field of electrical and computer engineering is multidisciplinary and based on foundations in science, mathematics, and computing\u2014both hardware and software. Reflecting this diversity, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) offers these two broad programs but is also a major partner in offering three more interdisciplinary programs, in Mechatronics Engineering, Nanotechnology Engineering, and Software Engineering. The Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering programs, described here, span the field in slightly different ways to give students a deep base of core knowledge with the ability to focus in one or more target areas. Students completing either program should gain the breadth of understanding necessary for lifelong learning in any area of electrical and computer engineering regardless of their choice of upper-year electives.",
